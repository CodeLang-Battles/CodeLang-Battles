Hi, I’m a programmer enthusiast and I created the hub @CodeLang-Battles to share my projects and experiences.
I’m interested in programming and cybersecurity.

The purpose of the @CodeLang-Battles is to compare smal programs/scripts written in different programming languages (especially C and Python) in some aspects like time and number of lines.
